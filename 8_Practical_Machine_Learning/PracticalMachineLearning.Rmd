Executive Summary
===
Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit have made it easier to collect massive amount of data about personal activity in a cheaper way. Tech geeks or enthusiats who like to keep track of their of their health and find a pattern in their behavior mostly use such devices. These sort of devices are used to record self movement. In this project, data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants will be used. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Loading libraries
===
```{r loadinglibrary}
library(caret)
library(gbm)
```

Loading Dataset
===
The dataset for this project are available here:
[training dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)

[testing dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

You can also download datafile and load data to R using following commands:
```{r downloaddata}
train_file <- "pml-training.csv"
test_file <- "pml-testing.csv" 
train_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
if (!file.exists(train_file)){
    download.file(train_url)    
}

test_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists(test_file)){
    download.file(test_url)  
}
```

Load the dataset into R
```{r loaddata, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
train_data <- read.csv(train_file, na.strings = c("#DIV/0!","NA"))
final_test_data <- read.csv(test_file, na.strings = c("#DIV/0!","NA"))
```

# Cleaning Data
First five columns(X,user_name,raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp) has no significance in building a prediction model. So, removing first five columns
```{r cleaningdata}
train_data <- subset(train_data, select = -(1:5))

# remove variables with nearly zero variance
zerovarIndex <- nearZeroVar(train_data)
train_data <- train_data[, -zerovarIndex]

# remove variables that are almost always NA
mostlyNA <- sapply(train_data, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.9
train_data <- train_data[, mostlyNA == F]
```

Model Building
===
I decided to use RandomForest model to see if it returns acceptable performance. I will be using `train` function in `caret` package to train the model and use 10-fold cross validation.


Lets use boosting algorithm with 10-fold cross validation to predict classe.
```{r boosting, cache = TRUE}
boostFit <- train(classe ~ ., method = "gbm", data = training_set, verbose = FALSE, trControl = modelcontrol)
```

Random Forest vs Boosting Model Evaluation
===
Use the fitted model to predict the classe in testing dataset. Confusion matrix will compare predicted vs actual values.
```{r Fitevaluation, cache=TRUE}
plot(rfFit, ylim = c(0.9, 1), main = "Random Forest model")
plot(boostFit, ylim = c(0.9, 1), main = "Boosting model")

# use the random forest model fitted to predict classe in testing set
rfFit_predicted <- predict(rfFit, newdata = testing_set)

# show confusion matrix to get estimate of out-of-sample error from prediction
confusionMatrix(testing_set$classe, rfFit_predicted)

# use the boosting model fitted to predict classe in testing set
boostFit_predicted <- predict(boostFit, newdata = testing_set)

# show confusion matrix to get estimate of out-of-sample error from prediction
confusionMatrix(testing_set$classe, boostFit_predicted)
```

From above comparison, random forest is the best model that can be used to fit the dataset. 
Out of Sample error
===
```{r oos, cache=TRUE}
## Calculate OOS Error
missClass = function(values, predicted) {
        sum(predicted != values) / length(values)
}
OOS_errRateRF = missClass(testing_set$classe, rfFit_predicted)
OOS_errRateRF
```

Estimated out of sample error rate for the random forests model is `r OOS_errRateRF` as reported by the final model.

Final Prediction
===
Finally, predicting the classe of testing dataset provided using the model selected and writing the result to files.
```{r prediction, cache=TRUE}
# predict on test set
preds <- predict(rfFit, newdata = final_test_data)

# convert predictions to character vector
preds <- as.character(preds)

# create function to write predictions to files
pml_write_files <- function(x) {
    n <- length(x)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        filename <- paste0("predicted_output/problem_id_", i, ".txt")
        write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
    }
}

# create prediction files to submit
pml_write_files(preds)
```
